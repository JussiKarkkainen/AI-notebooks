# AI-notebooks

Implementations of various Artificial Intelligence models from simple MLPs to more complicated ones like Transformers. All implememtations
are trained on relatively simple datasets and with modest compute, so the purpose of these models is to learn about different types of AI.
All models use PyTorch or are impemented from scratch. Future additions might also include tools to analyze the neural networks.


## Usage
First clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:JussiKarkkainen/AI-notebooks.git
cd AI-notebooks
```
You can train different models by running:
```
./train --model --dataset
```
Supported model and dataset combinations can be found in the implemented models list


## Current list of implemented models
- Multilayered Perceptron --mlp --mnist
